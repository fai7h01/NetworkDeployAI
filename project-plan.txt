1. Parse dataset and store it in structures;

2. Define pipeline type
   - objective: clearly differentiate between pipelines that are already built or in process,
     and those are free for deployment.
   - action:

3. Construct a graph representation
   - objective: Create a graph that capture both existing and potential new connections.
     - For pipelines marked as under construction, include their existing connections as edges
     with zero cost. Add an edge between each pair of consecutive nodes in pipelines.
     - For all pairs of nodes (across all pipeline), calculate potential new connections and assign costs based
     on their geographic distance. Skip adding new edge if its already included as a zero-cost edge from
     an empty pipelines.

4. Compute the minimal connection network
   - objective: Find set of connections that links all nodes into one network with the lowest total cost.
   - action: Substep 3.1: Gather all edges from the graph (both zero-cost edges from under-construction pipelines and distance-based edges for new connections).
             Substep 3.2: Sort all edges by their cost, from lowest to highest (zero-cost edges will naturally come first).
             Substep 3.3: Apply a method to select the minimal set of edges that connects all nodes without forming loops.

                 Start with each node as its own group.
                 Add edges in order of increasing cost, connecting groups only if they arenâ€™t already linked.

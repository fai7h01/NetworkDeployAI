PipelineDeployAI is an AI-powered decision support tool designed to optimize the deployment of next-generation telecom networks using existing pipeline sections (canalitzacions) managed by the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The platform allows third-party telecom operators to repurpose these pre-dug pipelines, reducing construction time and costs while navigating regulatory hurdles.

The tool integrates open-source pipeline data with supplementary information such as geospatial data (urban maps, zoning, population density), 
regulatory details (permit processes, policy guidelines), and technical data (network assets, vendor contracts). This data is used to create a dynamic digital twin of the existing infrastructure, 
simulating various deployment scenarios to assess pipeline capacity, network performance, and future scalability.

Machine learning is employed to evaluate the suitability of pipeline sections for different network technologies (e.g., fiber-optic, 5G). Predictive models help forecast business impacts such as cost efficiency, ROI, and service resilience, 
while also recommending the best pipeline sections for network upgrades.

A key feature of PipelineDeployAI is automated regulatory compliance. The platform decodes local regulations to generate tailored permit checklists, approval timelines, and vendor recommendations, 
making it easier for operators to comply with the approval process. It also analyzes past vendor data to propose cost-effective procurement strategies.

The user-friendly web-based interface, built with tools like Next.js, allows operators to input project parameters and receive detailed blueprints with cost estimates, permit requirements, and performance predictions. 
By streamlining network design, regulatory compliance, and procurement, PipelineDeployAI helps improve the efficiency of network deployments and enhances connectivity for public services

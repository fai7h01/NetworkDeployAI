# 🚀 NetworkDeployAI (LabLab.ai Hackathon)

**AI-powered decision support tool for optimizing telecom network deployments in Catalonia**

## 📌 Overview

**NetworkDeployAI** helps telecom operators efficiently deploy next-generation networks by repurposing **existing pipeline infrastructure**. Using **open-source data, machine learning, and geospatial analysis**, it provides cost-effective deployment recommendations while ensuring regulatory compliance. The tool visualizes **pipeline capacity, network performance, and future scalability**, allowing operators to make data-driven decisions and streamline approvals.

🌍 **How It Works:**

- **Data Integration:** Combines **open-source pipeline data** with **Google API, regulatory policies, zoning, and technical information**.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Uses **Spring AI & OpenAI API** to analyze pipeline suitability for fiber-optic and 5G deployments.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Displays geospatial insights using **Google Maps API** and predictive models.
- **Automated Compliance:** Generates tailored permit checklists and vendor recommendations.

🎯 **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Google API, OpenAI API
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring AI, PGVector
- **Data Processing:** Open-source datasets + trained models for real-time analysis
